# Sound Pez v.3

Processing sound trigger with the LeapMotion.

While I was still studying at Concordia some years ago, I used IR sensors and a microcontroller to build a [prototype of this project](http://jansensan.net/portfolio/sound-pez).

Recently, I wanted to reboot that project, which is what the [v.2 project](https://github.com/jansensan/sound-pez-2) does. I intended to use Arduino and Processing to rebuild the Sound Pez, and encase it into an aluminum body.

I got my hands on a [LeapMotion sensor](https://www.leapmotion.com/), this what v.3 will attempt to use.
